wavs/1.wav|It's my pleasure.
wavs/2.wav|Hello everybody, it's a me, Mario.
wavs/3.wav|Hello!
wavs/4.wav|Hello.
wavs/5.wav|Ha ha.
wavs/6.wav|Thank you very much for everyone who made this moment possible.
wavs/7.wav|The princess peach.
wavs/8.wav|My right hand man Luigi!
wavs/9.wav|And the best adviser in the business, Toad.
wavs/10.wav|So, starting today, I'm super duper excited.
wavs/11.wav|Well, I tell Nintendo.
wavs/12.wav|We need to make this game super duper!
wavs/13.wav|And they said.
wavs/14.wav|I said, nah.
wavs/15.wav|So they said.
wavs/16.wav|So I said, that's okay, but.
wavs/xd.wav|Have you thought about, four sports! Featuring over the top super duper moves, with none other than me, Mario!
wavs/18.wav|Ah, well, the hardest part, was to get all of these all stars on board.
wavs/19.wav|Some, they were easy.
wavs/20.wav|Toad, he's always hanging around giving me advice.
wavs/21.wav|And Luigi, well, he's my bro, he's got nothing to do, and he was up for it.
wavs/22.wav|Then, I saved the princess Peach, and Daisy.
wavs/23.wav|And I got Bowser to sign up while I was there.
wavs/24.wav|Wario, he was hard, because, he's cookoo crazy.
wavs/25.wav|Once, I mentioned it was not just volleyball, basketball, and hockey, but also dodgeball.
wavs/26.wav|Ha ha, he was all set.
wavs/27.wav|In fact, he said.
wavs/28.wav|Something like that.
wavs/29.wav|Woohoo, fire away! I'm ready for anything.
wavs/30.wav|Ha ha ha, well, I've got good news!
wavs/31.wav|Princess Peach.
wavs/32.wav|She hasn't been captured for a while, it's our longest streak yet.
wavs/33.wav|So, Mario's had more time to focus on saving the spikes and goals in hockey.
wavs/34.wav|Oh yeah, it's a great gear long workout.
wavs/35.wav|Mario highly recommends it.
wavs/36.wav|That's a good question.
wavs/37.wav|It has to be.
wavs/38.wav|Dodgeball!
wavs/39.wav|I'm always been a real fireballer.
wavs/40.wav|With a shell, or even, the fireballs, heh heh.
wavs/41.wav|So I knew, I would be a natural.
wavs/42.wav|But, I've noticed some of my friends, are taking shots at me!
wavs/43.wav|Heart shots from Princess Peach.
wavs/44.wav|Rainbow throws from my old pal yoshi.
wavs/45.wav|Even, a few vacumm wheezers sent at me by my fratello, Luigi!
wavs/46.wav|Oh!
wavs/47.wav|Ah Luigi, ha ha, he was probably taken, out of context.
wavs/48.wav|He loves being my sidekick, he he he.
wavs/49.wav|Gee that's funny.
wavs/50.wav|Oh yeah, it's true.
wavs/51.wav|Well, you know what they say, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
wavs/53.wav|Well, they don't call me Super Mario for nothing.
wavs/54.wav|Usually, I'm the winner.
wavs/55.wav|Yeah, anyways.
wavs/56.wav|Well, you know how it is. You always want to play with the best. And these guys gave me the best challenge. Mamma mia.
wavs/57.wav|I get a little tired, time and time again.
wavs/58.wav|One up in the competition.
wavs/59.wav|Just the other day, I was talking with Donkey Kong, and he said.
wavs/60.wav|Eh, I was.
wavs/61.wav|It's okay. Could be bigger.
wavs/62.wav|Well princess Stephanie, ha ha.
wavs/63.wav|I gotta say, at all of my adventures, it's nice to be on the other end of a bobomb once in a while.
wavs/64.wav|Well, I would have to say.
wavs/65.wav|That on all of these adventures, it's not about the stars you collect.
wavs/66.wav|The trophies you win.
wavs/67.wav|The amount of mushrooms you consume.
wavs/68.wav|Or even, the Yoshis you ride.
wavs/69.wav|It really, at the end of the day, is all about the friends you make.
wavs/70.wav|But, I also really like slamming, jamming on Bowser in this game!
wavs/71.wav|Well, I think my old friend Yoshi, is playing at a super high level.
wavs/72.wav|Mmmmm... yeah, you might.
wavs/73.wav|Well, this might sound kind of strange.
wavs/74.wav|But, I have a vision, of this beautiful question mark box.
wavs/75.wav|And I punch it.
wavs/76.wav|And the fantastic, one up mushroom pops out.
wavs/77.wav|And another!
wavs/78.wav|And again, and again, and again, hoo hooh!
wavs/79.wav|I can go on saving the princess forever, hee hee!
wavs/80.wav|Well, you know Mario, I'm going with my traditional blue overalls, of course.
wavs/81.wav|Looking good!
wavs/82.wav|Oh yeah.
wavs/83.wav|I would recommend it to any elite athletes.
wavs/84.wav|They are great for running, jumping, throwing the fireballs, and dominating.
wavs/85.wav|Ooh, my monster fire slam?
wavs/86.wav|Eh, you okay?
wavs/87.wav|Well, I have to say.
wavs/88.wav|The western junction hockey ring is real doozy.
wavs/89.wav|Yeah yeah, it's a lot like a normal ring, except this one has a choo choo come screaming down the center.
wavs/90.wav|Eh, we cried?
wavs/91.wav|How about, Mamma mia!
wavs/92.wav|Number one!
wavs/93.wav|Here we go!
